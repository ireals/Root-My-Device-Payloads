# Which exploit core the target's kernel needs. The attack chain is fixed to a
# GKI branch rather than to a SoC, so a target on a different kernel series
# needs a different core, not a different set of offsets:
#
#   core66   android15-6.6, from pmg110-root
#   core612  android16-6.12, from warhol-root (upstream popsicle plus its MTE fix)
#
# It is declared per target in src/targets.json and CI passes it down, so the
# default here only matters for a hand-typed build.

# Both cores are imported trees kept as close to the port they came from as
# they can be: core612 carries one delta against warhol-root and core66 three
# against pmg110-root, all listed in the README. The one file under $(CORE_DIR)
# that is *not* imported is root.c, which is this repository's own and is named
# so that a core's code stays in that core's directory:
#
#   <core>/root.c  how that core gets the bootstrap helper resident as root.
#                  Both cores reach a root context of their own and install
#                  from it (install_embedded_su -> root_helper.c); core66 also
#                  carries the usermodehelper route (install_android_root) its
#                  fops/pipe stage would need, which run_exploit() does not
#                  reach. One is linked per build, and it is listed apart from
#                  CORE_SRCS below so the build still says which side of the
#                  import each file is on.
#
# Neither port has a file by that name -- their own app glue is preload.c,
# su_daemon.c and an .incbin blob, none of which was copied -- so re-importing
# a core is still "replace everything here but root.c".
#
# What is this repository's own and shared by both cores:
#
#   mte.c          whether this boot's kernel tags heap pointers. Core-neutral
#                  and linked into every build; core612 is the one that reads
#                  it, because warhol's answer follows the flashed preloader
#                  rather than the firmware its target header came from.
#   preload.c      the retry supervisor, shared by both.
#   root_helper.c  getting the helper resident from a context that is already
#                  root, init hijack included. Linked only into the cores whose
#                  glue calls it -- see ROOT_HELPER_CORES below.

# -Isrc resolves the "targets/<...>/<header>" form that core66/offset.h
# includes -- it was "../targets/..." while the core sat directly under src/,
# which no longer resolves now that it is a level deeper. -I$(CORE_DIR) covers
# the core's own headers, and -I$(TARGET_DIR) any header
# the target header names as a sibling. That last one is why a target header
# does not have to spell out its own path: such an include expands inside a core
# .c file and would otherwise be resolved against the core directory.
# -I$(PAYLOAD_DIR) is for payload.h, which the glue and the supervisor share and
# which no core knows about.

# core66's offset.h names the target header through TARGET_HEADER; core612 came
# from popsicle, whose offset.h names it through TARGET_CONFIG_H. Defining both
# to the same include is what lets each core stay exactly as it was imported --
# editing one to agree with the other is how a foreign kernel's constants got
# into a core last time.
#
# TARGET_KERNEL_RELEASE is the last component of TARGET, which is the kernel
# release the target is stored under. core66 refuses to run on a kernel other
# than the one it was built for and needs the string to compare against; taking
# it from the path means it cannot disagree with where the target lives.
